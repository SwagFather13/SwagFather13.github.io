<p>I live the rich life by making the cash flow non stop and i keep the swag in the bank until its needed.</p>
<p>Also, i start to workout, usually using the 10lb weights for my body to gain swag.</p>
<p>Im currently at 15 years of age, making that hard cash flow</p>
<h2>What I do With the Rich Life</h2>
<p>I usually spend huge amounts of money on unimportant things such as toys and what not.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask me how i live like this, but people just dont get me and my life</p>
<p>In conclusion, i believe that more need to live the rich life and have the best baller skills</p>
<h3>How to get Rich</h3>

<p>This tree proves that people can plant money trees like me, that how i became rich, and you should try it to!
<p>If you don't have any money tree plants, you can resort to planting 100 dollar bills in the ground with pure fertilizer to make your tree grow in 30 minutes!</p>
<p>If everything else fails, you might have to resort to getting a job, and working long hours, doing terribly raw and powerful work that only them losa's do</p>
